Brief Summery :-
The project will show the prediction of diabetes in a patient based on different features like insulin, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
A cleaned data is used for this project.
Data preprocessing is done for making the values in the same range.
Different classification models are used for evaluation, which is primarily done on the basis of confusion matrix (F1-Score)
For further enhancing the model's prediction power GridSearch is used along with cross-validation.
